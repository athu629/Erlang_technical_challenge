Code to solve Erlang image manipulation challenge

This bit of code asks a user to input their chosen bpm file.
If a user types in the wrong file name and extension, they will get a "File not found error"

Once the file name has been successfully entered, the code will then prompt the user to select an angle of degree 0, 45, 90 or 180.
If the user does not put in one of these values, it will ask the user to "try again"

Once both filename and degree of rotation are successfully input, the code will show the pbm.
